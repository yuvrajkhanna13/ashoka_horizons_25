This report documents the data collected from a home kitchen as part of Week 1 of the Ashoka Horizons course.

Why these fields were chosen:
- We tracked ingredients to monitor consumption and manage inventory.
- Quantities and units were included for precision.
- A separate nutrition file was created to summarize health-related data (calories, protein, etc.).

Why split the data:
- Ingredients and nutritional values represent different levels of granularity.
- Keeping them separate allows for easier analysis (e.g., linking many ingredients to one dish in the nutrition file).

Environment Setup:
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) was installed via Microsoft Store.
- Miniconda was downloaded from the official site and installed in WSL.
- A conda environment was created using:
  conda create -n horizons python=3.11
  conda activate horizons

All files have been generated automatically and stored for review in the 'week-01' folder.
