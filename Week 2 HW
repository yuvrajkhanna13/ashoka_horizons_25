1. Probability
Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible, 0.5 implies a 50% chance, and 1 means certainty.
2. Rolling a 3
A six-sided die has 6 outcomes. Rolling a 3 is one favorable outcome. So, probability = 1/6.
3. Measures of Central Tendency
Mean, Median, and Mode.
4. Purpose of Descriptive Statistics
To summarize, describe, and understand the key features of a dataset.
5. Range Definition
Range = Max - Min. For [60, 70, 80, 90, 100], Range = 100 - 60 = 40.
6. Variance vs Std Deviation
Variance is the average squared deviation from the mean; SD is the square root of variance, in original units for easier interpretation.
7. Probability in ML
ML models often predict probabilities (e.g., email being spam). Understanding these is key to interpreting output and risk.
8. Median over Mean
When the data is skewed or has outliers (e.g., housing prices), the median better represents the center.
9. Data Exploration
It means examining data to find patterns, trends, anomalies, and guide preprocessing before modeling.
10. FRDA Case Study
It showed that data and methods together enable insights — without both, critical patterns like gene-disease links would be missed.
11. Large Std Deviation
It suggests prices vary widely, so the mean might not reflect typical values. This could mislead interpretations.
12. Volcano Plot
It visualizes which genes are significantly and strongly affected. Up-regulated = higher activity, Down-regulated = lower activity.
13. Definition of ML
Arthur Samuel: ML is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
14. Three Types of ML
Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
15. Classification vs Regression
Classification predicts categories (e.g., spam detection), regression predicts numbers (e.g., house prices).
16. Goal of Unsupervised Learning
To find hidden patterns or groupings in data without labels.
17. PCA
Principal Component Analysis reduces data dimensionality while preserving variance.
18. Traditional vs ML
Traditional: Rules + Data → Output. ML: Data + Output → learns Rules.
19. Learning from Examples
ML learns by observing many examples. For cats, it learns by seeing many labeled images.
20. Agent in RL
An agent interacts with an environment and learns via rewards and punishments.
21. Common Algorithms
Supervised: Linear Regression, Decision Trees; Unsupervised: K-Means.
22. Preprocessing Importance
Without proper preprocessing, models can learn from noise, leading to poor performance and bias.
23. Spam Filter Error
Marking real mail as spam is a False Positive. It’s bad because it hides important messages.
24. Definition of AI
AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
25. AI vs ML vs DL
AI is the broadest, ML is a subset of AI, and DL is a subset of ML.
26. Three Types of AI
Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI. Today we have only Narrow AI.
27. AI Foundations
Logic and Search; Probability and Statistics.
28. AI Thinking vs Acting
Thinking humanly = mimicking thought; Acting rationally = optimizing outcomes.
29. NLP
Natural Language Processing helps machines understand human language. Example: Chatbots.
30. Generative AI
It creates new content (text, images). Unlike analytics AI, it generates original outputs.
31. Bias in AI
AI learns bias from biased data. E.g., facial recognition performing poorly on minorities.
32. Explainability in AI
Understanding AI decisions builds trust, especially in healthcare, where wrong predictions can cost lives.
