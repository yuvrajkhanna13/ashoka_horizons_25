1(a) Clarity, Precision, Efficiency
Clarity means easy to understand. Precision means exact data representation. Efficiency means communicating maximum info with minimal effort.
1(b) Example
A rainbow pie chart with 10 segments lacks clarity. A horizontal bar chart would be clearer.
2(a) Why Visualization is Important
Data is everywhere. Visualization turns massive, raw data into insights quickly.
2(b) Extracting Value
Visualization helps detect patterns, like seasonal trends in sales, which raw tables may hide.
3(a) Exploratory Scenario
Exploring correlations between air pollution and asthma across cities. Goal: discovery.
3(b) Explanatory Scenario
Presenting findings of pollution-asthma link to city council. Goal: persuasion and clarity.
4(a) Most Effective Channels
Position and length are best for quantitative data. They're perceptually accurate and easy to compare.
4(b) Identity Channels
Used to distinguish categories. Example: colors representing different car brands in a plot.
5. Expressiveness & Effectiveness
Expressiveness = all needed info shown. Effectiveness = data shown in most perceptible way. Both ensure clarity and accuracy.
6(a) Nightingale Chart
A polar area chart showing causes of soldier deaths in Crimean War.
6(b) Primary Message
Most deaths were preventable diseases, not battle injuries.
6(c) Visual Design Impact
Large colored wedges made death causes visually striking, easy to compare.
7(a) Color Palettes
Qualitative: categories (e.g., countries). Sequential: numeric scale (e.g., temperature). Diverging: deviations (e.g., profit/loss).
7(b) Colorblindness & Accessibility
Colorblind users may confuse red/green. Use colorblind-friendly palettes and add texture/labels.
8. Planning Questions
1. What’s the question? 2. Who’s the audience? 3. What data is needed? These guide effective design.
9(a) Dynamic Viz Advantages
Interactive visualizations offer user control, layering of detail, and better engagement.
9(b) Example of Interactivity
Tooltips show exact values on hover, keeping chart clean but info-rich.
10(a) Creative Coding Meaning
Coding with aesthetics in mind, blending data, design, and interaction.
10(b) Example
Wind Map (hint.fm/wind) shows wind flow patterns across the US. Visually engaging and informative.
